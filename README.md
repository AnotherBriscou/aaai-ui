# aiii-ui

[AIII UI](https://artificial-art.eu/) Is a fork of (https://github.com/aqualxx/stable-ui) a web user interface to generate, save, and view images using Stable Diffusion, with the goal being able to provide Stable Diffusion to anyone for 100% free. Discord (https://discord.gg/CuEJzkgr2C).

This is achieved using [Stable Horde](https://stablehorde.net/), a crowdsourced distributed cluster of Stable Diffusion workers, which makes this tool available for anyone to use regardless if they don't have the processing power to run Stable Diffusion themselves.
